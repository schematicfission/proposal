#####Summary:
Data analysis tools are extremely high in demand. However, one
known issue with data analysis is an inconsistency in formatting
between different data sources. Is my data compatible with the
analysis tool I’m trying to use? This problem is only exacerbated
when data is represented inconsistently between various mediums.
Take for example a team of two, each trying to represent
the same structured data. Let’s say that one person decided to
create an Excel spreadsheet while the other wrote a Python script
to populate a CSV file. What if they chose inconsistent names of
attributes for enumerated types (i.e. “female” vs. “f” vs. “Female”)?
What if one person decided to leave some cells blank,
while the other didn’t? What if the person entering into Excel
had typos that were corrupting various aggregation results? Suddenly,
the team’s simple task of trying to merge and aggregate
their data with some analysis tool becomes much more complicated.
